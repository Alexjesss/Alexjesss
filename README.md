## Get to know me! :raising_hand_woman:

My name is Alexandra. I live in Antwerp, Belgium and I'm 27 years old.
From the gif above some would guess that I'm into nature and for those who guessed it, you were absolutely right!

I like nature, especially forests, because they give me a very deep sense of peace within and relaxation.

Besides :deciduous_tree: I also love and like being creative. For me creativity is really a necessity and I can't live without it.
So besides nature and hiking, things I also love and do are:

- (#1 passion in life) : acting :movie_camera: :heartbeat: 
- making art
- making music
- watching movies & series
- reading articles about actors/movies, making of, etc

### Now enough about me, what about coding?

I started a web developer course (bootcamp style) in January in Antwerp @ Becode.
So far I really like it and I've learned a lot in a very short time. Coding for me is very challenging but also rewarding when it all works.
My github is a combination of the courses exercises but in the very near future, as of now, I'm going to add additional exercises for me to improve and look back at to see my progression.
I'd like my github to be like some sort of practical diary of this new step in my life. Also I will add some mini projects that I'd like to create.

Because I'm a creative being it came natural to me to be interested in Front-end development. We will see what the future brings!
